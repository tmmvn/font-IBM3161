I use `IBM3161APL.otb` in X11 emacs.

The regular version pads all characters to 16 pixels wide.

I think I called it `IBM3161APL.otb` because I discovered that the APL version
of Unifont worked fine in emacs. I forget if I actually built it using
Unifont's APL build target, though.

That's what happens when you don't document stuff the first time... But hey,
live and learn, right? :p
