       This program converts X11 fonts in  BDF  format  to  Amiga
       assembly,  which  can  then  be assembled and linked on an
       Amiga to generate Amiga bitmapped  fonts.   The  generated
       assembly  is  saved in a file whose name is formed by con-
       catenating the family name of the font (e.g., Times),  its
       point  size,  and, if the font is bold or italic, the let-
       ters _i and/or _b, as appropriate, and  with  extension  _._a_.
       E.g.,  for a Times font with size 12, the generated assem-
       bly file will be called _T_i_m_e_s_1_2_._a.

              This option specifies the directory where the  gen-
              erated  assembly file will be created.  The default
              is the current directory.

       --ff FFaammiillyyNNaammee
              Overrides the font family name contained in the BDF
              file  with  _F_a_m_i_l_y_N_a_m_e.  As the font family name is
              used to form the name  of  the  output  file,  this
              option  is  useful  for  fonts  that do not contain
              their family name in the BDF file.

       _-_h     Displays a short help message.

       _-_i     Instructs _b_d_f_2_a_m_i_g_a not to generate  references  to
              Amiga  header  files, generating EQU directives for
              the symbols required by the generated  code.   This
              is  not  safe,  as  the information in these header
              files may change in the future.  Thus,  you  should
              only  use  this option if you do not have access to
              the header files.

       _-_v     Displays the program version.

       +o X11 fonts in BDF format.  An excellent source  for  such
         fonts,  and the reason that this program was written, is
         the FreeType package
         (http://www.physiol.med.tu-muenchen.de/~robert/freetype.html),
         a TrueType engine which comes with a font previewer  for
         the  Amiga  and  a  TrueType  to BDF conversion utility.
         (The latter is contained in  the  ``full''  distribution
         package.)

       +o An assembler.  I have used a68k successfully.

         as well.

       Let us say that you want to convert a font  called  Fancy-
       Font12.bdf  to  Amiga  format.   This can be done with the
       following steps:

       1. Convert  the  font  to  Amiga   assembly   code   using
          _b_d_f_2_a_m_i_g_a:
          bdf2amiga FancyFont12.bdf
       This  will  create  a  file  called  something like Fancy-
       Font15.a (see the bugs section).

       2. Assemble the font:
          a68k -iinclude: FancyFont15.a
       This will generate FancyFont15.o.

       3. Link the font:
          blink from FancyFont15.o to 15
          or
          slink from FancyFont15.o to 15 noicons
          depending on which linker you use.
       This will generate file 15, which is  the  font  in  Amiga
       format.

       4. Create a directory named FancyFont in the FONTS: direc-
          tory, and put file 15 there.  Run fixfonts to  generate
          FONTS:FancyFont.font  and to make the font available to
          your Amiga.  (If you are  converting  many  fonts,  you
          need  only  run fixfonts once, after all the fonts have
          been converted.)

BBUUGGSS
       On the Amiga, the size of a font is its vertical  size  in
       pixels,  and  not its point size, which is a rough measure
       of the width of the font's characters.  As X11  font  size
       is  point  size,  this has the result that the size of the
       generated font is different from the original.

       This program has been tested mainly with  fonts  generated
       by  the _t_t_f_2_b_d_f program that comes with the FreeType pack-
       age, and only briefly tested with other fonts.  If you add
       to this that, since I didn't have any documentation on the
       BDF format, I had to guess its  structure  by  staring  at
       sample  fonts, finding a font that breaks _b_d_f_2_a_m_i_g_a should
       not be very difficult.  Let me know, and I'll see if I can
       provide a fix.
