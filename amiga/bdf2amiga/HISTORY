Version 1.0, 13-May-1998

  First Public release.


Version 1.1, 17-May-1998

  Fixed width fonts are now handled correctly. Fixed width fonts generated
  with version 1.0 did not behave completely as such, and had severe
  problems when used in a shell window.

  Corrected a potential problem with the way spacing and kerning
  information was generated for undefined characters between the first
  and last defined character in the font.


Version 1.2, 25-May-1998

  Added a SECTION directive to the generated assembly code, to make it
  possible to assemble the code using SAS/C's asm.


Version 1.3, 20-Aug-1998

  Treat all non-proportional fonts as monospace rather than all
  non-monospace fonts as proportional. This will render character cell
  fonts correctly (or, at least, less incorrectly).


Version 1.4, 02-Apr-2020

  Different author (Wyatt Ward).

  Altered Makefile and source code to compile on modern Unix systems, and
  added new Makefile.win32 and provisions to source for compiling for Windows
  (currently untested but likely to work; it does compile in Mingw).
